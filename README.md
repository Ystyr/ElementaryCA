# ElementaryCA
Unity3D implementation of [Elementary Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton)
The neat thing about this implementation is that it calculates the next step of CA based on a rule encoded in a single byte. 
This way it can implement all 256 elementary rules in just a few lines of code via binary operations.  
Recomended to run on portrait orientation/layout with a resolution of 1080x1920.
